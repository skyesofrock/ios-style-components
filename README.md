# iOS-style Components (v0.0.1)
Just some CSS experiments with iOS style UI components.

### iOS Toggle
Built entirely using SCSS; you can customise the dimensions of the toggle using the original SCSS file and compiling it yourself, or you can include the `ios-toggle.css` and use the standard dimensions.  
All you need to do is apply the class `ios-toggle` to the input (checkbox supported currently), and place a label *after* it. The toggle is right-aligned inside the container element.
